# Labeling The Carbon Dioxide Emissions Data Depending on Different Features By K-Means Clustering and Analysis Different Models Depending on Their Accuracy

The endless increase of Carbon Dioxide Emission is a serious challenge all over the world, and many countries are striving to solve this problem. Hence classifying vehicles based on their CO2 emissions level would help to identify the vehicleâ€™s echo friendliness. In this work, I cluster vehicles in an optimum number of groups, say 3, obtained by elbow method, using K-means clustering algorithm. For this study, I choose freely available [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles) about Amount of CO2 emissions by a vehicle depending on their various features, label those data by clustering them. I build different predicting models and compare them to see the performance of those models. The SVM model gives better performance than KNN, decision tree.

## Sample Results
